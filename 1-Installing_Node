## Installing Node
Node is an ever updating platform, so the best way to install it is using Node Version Manager ([NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)), a version manager that will save you a lot of trouble when changing between node versions.

To see versions of Node available to install run
```
nvm ls-remote
```
To install a version of node run
```
nvm install <version>
```
To see the Node versions you have installed run
```
nvm ls
```
To use a specific node version use 
```
nvm use <version>
```
